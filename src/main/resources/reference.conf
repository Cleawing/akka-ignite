  # Ignite has an optional notion of client and server nodes.
  # Server nodes participate in caching, compute execution, stream processing, etc.,
  # while the native client nodes provide ability to connect to the servers remotely.
  # Ignite native clients allow to use the whole set of Ignite APIs, including near caching,
  # transactions, compute, streaming, services, etc. from the client side.
  #
  # By default, all Ignite nodes are started as server nodes, and client mode needs to be explicitly enabled.
